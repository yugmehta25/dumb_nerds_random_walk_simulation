# dumb_nerds_random_walk_simulation
project in python for a random walk simulation and analyzing the statistical property

A randomized walk simulator in 2D is a computational simulation that models the random movement of a point (or particle) in a two-dimensional space. This type of simulation is often used in physics, biology, and computer science to study phenomena like diffusion, stock market fluctuations, and animal movement patterns.

ROLES OF THE TEAM MEMBERS

NISHANT IYER - KU2407U455 & UJJVAL THAKKAR - KU2407U677 - Algorithm Developers and oversee the implementation for the logic of the random walk simulation. We optimised the project code for generating random coordinates using matplotlib and numpy modules and debugging the issues to ensure achieving the desired result

SHASHWAT CHOUDHURY - KU2407U690 - Team coordinator, overseeing the entire project; managing the final integration of the code, visualisation and documentation. assisting between the communication within the team to keep the moral of the entire team while handling the plans and task allocation.

YUG MEHTA - KU2407U776 - data visualisation with his prior expertise in python and understanding of the modules, guidance in designing and methodology. Overseeing the proper structure and output derived results, managing the expectations to handle plotting and graph projection.

CHALLANGES FACED

Coordination and communication - Ensuring that all the team members are on the same page and coordinating instructions to implementing project logic.

Integration of work - combining the contribuitions from YUG to helping NISHANT and UJJVAL to implement flow of code and deriving the desired result

Technical Issue - debugging and test runs posed a major setback continously due to inefficient compilation of code.

Knowledge Gaps - with differnce in expertise in various fields of python, managing with the team to ensure proper dynamics,tools and concept; oraganising discussion to visualise our end goal was a pivoting step to making it a success.

Resource Management - limited resource options within our knowledge of expertise and deriving it into our source code to initialise and optimise integration of large data sets and graph plotting.
